# Hill-Climbing-Travelling-Salesman

An algorithm to minimize the distance travelled by a salesman across several cities. There are two types of the algorithm implemented; simple restart and highest descent hill climbing. 

# Code files
For each algorithm type there is a .py code file i.e. "Hill_climbing_simple.py" and "Hill_climbing_steepest_descent.py".

Run the desired .py file and the output will be written in the "results" directory. Results include a text file contatining information such as the distance covered for each iteration, execution time, and also the best found traverse sequence. Also a plot depicting the relation between number of iterations and total distance covered.

Sample output plot
