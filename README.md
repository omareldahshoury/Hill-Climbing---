# Hill-Climbing-Travelling-Salesman

An algorithm to minimize the distance travelled by a salesman across several cities. There are two types of the algorithm implemented; simple restart and highest descent hill climbing. 

# Code files
For each algorithm type there is a .py code file i.e. "Hill_climbing_simple.py" and "Hill_climbing_steepest_descent.py".

$x^2$

Run the desired .py file and the output will be written in the "results" directory. Results include distance covered for each iteration, also the best found traverse sequence.
